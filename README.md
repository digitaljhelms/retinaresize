When an image file whose name begins with "Screen Shot" is written to the Desktop folder, the resolution is reduced to 72 dpi and the width/height dimensions are scaled down 50%. The image file is tagged with `#retinareduced` as a Spotlight comment to prevent rezising from being run subsequent times against the same image.
